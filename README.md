        I1.Write a Python program to get a single string from two given strings,
        separated by a space and swap the first two characters of each string.
        I2.Write a Python program to add 'ing' at the end of a given string
        (length should be at least 3). If the given string already ends with 'ing' then add 'ly' instead
